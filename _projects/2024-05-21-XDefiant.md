## Description

I worked primarily as a 3C (Character, Camera, and Control) programmer on XDefiant. In this role, I collaborated with designers and tech animators to enhance character statesm, animation graphs, replication, and attachments.

As the primary engineer for navigation interactions, I maintained and developed features for Mantle and ladder mechanics. I also adapted an existing third-person spectator camera into a first-person solution. Additionally, I contributed to resolving bugs across various areas, including replication and physics, ensuring stability and performance throughout multiple seasons.
