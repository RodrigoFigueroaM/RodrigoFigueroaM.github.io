## Description
On *Lone Echo II*, I worked primarily on the 3D navigation system, power system, creep animation and gameplay, as well as other gameplay components, while contributing to the overall performance optimization of the game.

As the primary engineer for the 3D navigation system, I developed a specialized navigation mesh, along with its build process, pathfinding logic, and navigation usage, ensuring smooth and efficient AI movement.

Having joined the project during preproduction, I also collaborated with designers to prototype and iterate on new mechanics, helping shape the core gameplay experience.
