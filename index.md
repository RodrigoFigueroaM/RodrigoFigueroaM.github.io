  I’m a passionate gameplay programmer who previously worked at Ubisoft and Ready At Dawn, including during its acquisition by Meta. I helped bring to life XDefiant and Lone Echo II. You can learn more about my work on each projects page.

  I love using my skills, time, passion, and knowledge to contribute to the innovative software and games. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. I’m a quick learner who is detailed oriented and can adapt to a fast paced, team-based environment. I can generate well-documented, high quality, production ready code.

  My interests have always revolved around Computer Graphics, 3D Math, and Algorithms. Professionally, I’ve worked on AI, Animation, Cameras, Inputs, Physics, and more. Back in college, I worked on a research project involving curves and curve surfaces, which deepened my passion for technical problem-solving
