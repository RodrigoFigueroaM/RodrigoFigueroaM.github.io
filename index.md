  # Rodrigo Figueroa
  
  Hello, my name is Rodrigo. I love using my skills, time, passion, and knowledge to contribute to the innovative software. I recently graduated with a Bachelors degree in computer science from California State University, Fullerton. Iâ€™m a quick learner who is detailed oriented and can adapt to a fast paced, team-based environment. I can generate well-documented, high quality code.

  I have always been interested in Computer Graphics, Web Development, 3D Math, and 3D Algorithms ever since I started computer science. I worked on a research project involving curves and curve surfaces. I enjoy developing tools that allow for usability, reliability, and maintainability.
